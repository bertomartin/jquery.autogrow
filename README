This is a simple jquery plugin that mimics the Facebook textarea autogrow 
frature.

The difference with others in the wild is that it's fast, and bu fast I mean, if 
you push <Enter>, the textarea will immediately grow (on keydown), not onkeyup.
It's a small difference but an important one in my opinion.
